Got my Arduino Duemilanove in today :) Hoping to be able to do some pretty cool projects with it. I have a basic blink speed test converting in Vimeo right now that I'll post whenever it gets finished. 

From the definition on the [Arduino Site](https://www.arduino.cc): 

"Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments." 

I got my Arduino from [Adafruit Industries](https://www.adafruit.com). They have a pretty nice starter package you can get from this link:
