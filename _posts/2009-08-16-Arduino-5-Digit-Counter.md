Working off of some of the [Ladyada tutorials](https://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino) , I made a modification to one with light modes to make a simple binary counter with LEDs. I'm having a lot of fun with the Arduino so far, and have plans for a project to hook it up to my Robosapien v1. I'll be posting more information on that when I start on it.
